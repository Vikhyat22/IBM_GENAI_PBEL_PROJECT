This Google Colab notebook showcases how to generate high-quality images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion, a powerful latent diffusion model developed for text-to-image generation.

By utilizing the StableDiffusionPipeline from Hugging Face’s diffusers library, this project allows users to input a natural language description and receive a corresponding image created by the model.

Stable Diffusion is efficient, open-source, and capable of producing creative, realistic visuals — making it a valuable tool for developers, artists, and AI enthusiasts exploring generative models in visual media.
